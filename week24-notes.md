## 6-Month GitHub Docs Training Reflection

This training helped me develop a full-stack understanding of GitHub from the perspective of an API Technical Writer.

### What I Accomplished

- Built and published a modular, versioned API documentation site
- Used GitHub Actions to automate markdown linting and spell checking
- Created pull requests, reviewed content, and managed issues
- Learned how to organize, link, and present high-quality developer docs

### What I’m Most Proud Of

Publishing a live documentation site using GitHub Pages and YAML configuration. It’s clean, functional, and production-ready.

### What's Next

- Apply these skills to real product docs or internal tools
- Start contributing to larger open source projects
- Learn static site generators like Docusaurus or MkDocs
