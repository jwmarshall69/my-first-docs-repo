## 🧠 What Is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions let you create workflows that run when events happen in your repo (e.g., push, PR). It's like setting up your own little robot that checks your work every time you update your docs.

These workflows are written in YAML and stored in   `.github/workflows/`.
