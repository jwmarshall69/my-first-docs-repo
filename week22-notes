## 📝 Notes - Week 22 Highlights

### Repo Analyzed: stripe/stripe-api-docs

- Folders grouped by product (`payments`, `connect`)
- Heavy use of `_data` and `_includes` for layout logic
- All content stored in Markdown with front matter
- GitHub Actions used to lint and test builds
- Clean README and `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Repo Analyzed: postmanlabs/postman-docs

- Docs live in `src/pages`
- OpenAPI specs integrated via Redoc

### Takeaways for My Project

- Use consistent hyphenated filenames
- Add `_data.yml` if building sidebar nav later
- Possibly separate reference and guide content
