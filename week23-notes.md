## 🧠 What Is Meta-Documentation?

It’s documentation about your documentation project—useful for devs, contributors, and hiring managers. It answers:

- Why was this created?
- How is the content structured?
- How can others contribute?
- How is it deployed (e.g., GitHub Pages + Actions)?

# Meta-Documentation

This site was built using Docs-as-Code best practices:

### 🧹 3. Polish Your Commit History

Use git log or GitHub Desktop to:

✅ If needed, squash or clean them in a new branch

### 🖼️ 4. Add Visual Polish

- Use emojis in your `README.md` headers for readability
- Add a screenshot of your GitHub Pages site in the `README.md`

```bash

![Docs Site Screenshot](./screenshot.png)
