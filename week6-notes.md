## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn how to review and merge changes
- Use GitHub’s review tools
- Merge your feature branch into main

## 🧠 What’s a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another (usually into `main`). It allows:

- Code/doc review before merging
- Comments and suggestions from teammates
- Continuous integration (CI) checks to run

As a technical writer, PRs are where you and developers can collaborate, provide feedback, and ensure quality.

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Go to Your Pull Request on GitHub

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) → your repo
- Click on the Pull Requests tab
- Open the PR you created in Week 5 (`feature/api-overview`)

### 2. Review Your PR

Even if you’re the only contributor for now:

- Read the file in the “Files changed” tab
- Use the Review changes button (top right)
- Choose "Approve" (or leave a comment like "Looks good to me!")

### 3. Merge the PR

- Click the green Merge pull request button
- Optionally edit the merge message
- Click Confirm merge
- Click Delete branch (optional but recommended—it keeps things tidy)

🎉 Boom! You just completed a full review-merge cycle.

## 🧪 Optional Practice: Merge a Fix Branch

- Create a small branch: fix/week5-note-title
- Edit your week5-notes.md file (change a heading or fix a typo)
- Commit & push it
- Open and merge a PR for that fix
