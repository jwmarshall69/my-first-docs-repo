# Meta-Documentation

This site was built using Docs-as-Code best practices:

- Each doc page uses YAML front matter
- Internal links are used to connect sections
- GitHub Actions check all Markdown on push
- Version 1.0 is tagged using Git and released via GitHub Releases

Built as part of a 6-month GitHub training plan.
