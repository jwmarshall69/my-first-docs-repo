## 🧠 What Are Git Tags?

A Git tag marks a specific point in your commit history—often used to mark a release version. For example:

| Tag     | Purpose                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `v1.0`  | First stable release         |
| `v1.1`  | Minor update                 |
| `v2.0`  | Major changes/new structure  |

### Tags help users and teams reference or roll to a specific state of the repo-like a frozen snapshot of your documentation
