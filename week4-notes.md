🧠 What’s a Branch?

Think of a branch as a “sandbox” or side version of your project. You can work on a new feature or document without affecting the main branch (often called `main` or `master`). When your work is ready, you merge it back into the main branch.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Create a New Branch in GitHub Desktop

- Open GitHub Desktop
- Go to Branch > New Branch
- Name it: `feature/week4-notes`
- Base branch: `main`
- Click Create Branch

GitHub Desktop will switch you to this new branch automatically.

### 2. Open the Branch in VS Code

- Open your project folder (`my-first-docs-repo`)
- Create a new file: `week4-notes.md`
- Paste this starter content

``` bash
# Week 4 Notes – Branching and Pushing

- Created a new branch called `feature/week4-notes`
- Wrote notes about Git branching
- Pushed my branch to GitHub
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

In GitHub Desktop:

- You’ll see the new file listed under “Changes”
- Add a summary: `Add week4-notes.md`
- Click Commit to feature/week4-notes

### 4. Push the Branch

- After committing, click Push origin in the top bar
- This uploads your new branch to GitHub

### 5. Open a Pull Request

- On github.com, go to your repo
- GitHub will suggest creating a Pull Request for your new branch
- Click Compare & Pull Request
- Add a title: `Add Week 4 Notes`
- Leave a short description and click **Create Pull Request**
